# SkytrainingTask2
I built this project based on three big components (home, profiles, vacationrequest) where they are shown based on the current path(route), 
also built reusable components to be used across the three main components above.
components are directly shown in the 'app' directory.
I aslo built services to get static data for cards and employee , exist under the services folder of the app folder.
also included Bootstrap and font awesom.
applied the data binding techniques where fit.
also handled data transfer between parent and child where fits.
used pipes where fit.
added search based on id of the employee(assumed the order is the id, could've included the id in the json but chose not for simplicity reasons as idea is the same).
